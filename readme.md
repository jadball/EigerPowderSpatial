Here are a pair of Jupyter notebooks that were used to fit the spatial distortion of the Eiger4M CdTe detector at ID11.

They work by fitting the diffraction geometry for a series of images of powder patterns with different beam centers.

You will need to edit/modify them for any other detector geometry. 
If you can log in at ESRF you can find the data files referenced here.
